FIXME: Setup instructions live in this document. Please specify the tools and
the data sets the Learner needs to have installed.

## Data Sets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
Download the sample data, taken from a microbiome  sequencing project investigating
sexually dimorphic metagenomes associated with garter snake tissues:

systems (and potentially add more, e.g. online setup) in the solutions blocks.
